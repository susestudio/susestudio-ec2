README for SUSE Studio Amazon EC2 appliance
------------------------------------------------

This tarball contains the Amazon EC2 appliance created by SUSE Studio and the
create_ebs_ami.sh script. The script uploads the appliance to Amazon EC2 to
create an Elastic Block Storage (EBS) backed Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

The Amazon EC2 API tools must be installed for the script to work. It can be
found at:

  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351

Additional help on setting up these tools can be found here:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/setting-up-your-tools.html

In order to access Amazon Web Services (AWS), the script requires the following
environment variables to be defined:

  $AWS_USER_ID     - AWS user ID (eg. 123456789012)
  $AWS_ACCESS_KEY  - AWS access key ID (eg. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST)
  $AWS_SECRET_KEY  - AWS secret access key (eg. abcdefghijklmnoprqrtuvwxyzabcdv)
  $EC2_CERT        - Path to EC2 X.509 certification (eg. ~/cert-aws.pem)
  $EC2_PRIVATE_KEY - Path to EC2 private key (eg. ~/pk-ec2.pem)

e recommend setting these variables in your ~/.profile file so that you don't have to
set them up manually each time, eg:
export AWS_USER_ID=123456789012
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=abcdefghijklmnoprqrtuvwxyzabcdv
export EC2_CERT=~/cert-aws.pem
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=~/pk-ec2.pem

Now create your AMI with the specific Amazon region (us-west-1, us-east-1, eu-west-1,
ap-southeast-1...), eg:
./create_ebs_ami.sh --region eu-west-1

One way to launch new instances of your AMI is with the command line tools, eg:
ec2-run-instances ami-6a380d1e -t m1.small --region eu-west-1 -k bbrunner-eu
You'll want to create your SSH keypair in Amazon first if you don't already have
one (specified by the -k option) as password based authentication is
automatically disabled.
Wait for the instance to boot and check for it's DNS name with ec2-describe-instances,
and then you can ssh into it once it fully boots up, eg:
ssh -i ~/ec2-eu root@ec2-46-51-133-248.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
Don't forget to terminate the instance when you're done, eg:
ec2-terminate-instances

Other way to manage your Amazon EC2 and S3 accounts, is using ElasticFox and S3Fox
Firefox plugins.

Normal execution of the create_ebs_ami.sh script looks like this:

  jamestyj@sg:/> tar xf My_EC2.x86_64-0.0.1.ec2.tar.gz
  jamestyj@sg:/> cd My_EC2-0.0.1
  jamestyj@sg:/My_EC2-0.0.1> ./create_ebs_ami.sh --region eu-west-1
